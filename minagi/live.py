"""
Learning from a conversation while it happens.

ONE STREAM. The model reads everything it is given and everything it writes as
a single continuous stream of characters, and takes an optimiser step every
`chunk` of them - the same mechanism minagi/stream.py uses on a corpus, with
the interleaving between subjects removed, because a conversation is one
subject. There is no per-exchange boundary and nothing is re-read: the cursor
only moves forward. What the model sees at every step is the last `context`
characters, and the gradient reaches all of them.

That symmetry is the point. The thing that learns from a book and the thing
that learns from you are the same code path at the same granularity, so there
is no second mechanism to reason about and no regime the model was never
trained in.

WHAT THIS COSTS, AND IT IS NOT MEASURED IN THE CURRENT REGIME. Learning from a
conversation is learning partly from the model's own output, and reading a few
hundred characters of chat under many gradient steps is a far denser diet than
a corpus. In an earlier, denser variant - short turns re-read many times - that
cost around +0.65 nats on held-out against +0.02 for real documents of the same
length, so most of the damage came from the step density rather than from
self-training as such.

Streaming continuously is a lighter regime: the cursor only advances, text
leaves the window, and nothing is read twice at the same position. Whether the
cost is still material here is UNKNOWN and would have to be measured. It is
stated rather than assumed away.

A smaller learning rate is not the fix. Descent has a direction, and on the
model's own argmax that direction is to confirm it; a lower rate confirms it
more slowly.
