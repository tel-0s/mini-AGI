"""
Reading a pile of files.

The model's alphabet is the 256 byte values, so there is nothing to prepare: a
file is already written in the only vocabulary it has. Point it at a directory
and it reads what is there - source, prose, notes, logs, transcripts - in
whatever order they come, and is different afterwards.

That is the whole interface. No tokenizer to fit, no corpus to build, no
preprocessing step that has to be re-run when the data changes.

Binary files are skipped rather than read as noise: a file is taken as text if
a sample of it decodes as UTF-8 and is mostly printable. Everything else is
left alone, because a model that reads a JPEG learns what a JPEG header looks
like and nothing else useful.
